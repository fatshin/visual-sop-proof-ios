# Agent Policy Compiler — Submission

**Tagline:** Turn policy prose into a decision system you can audit.

**Category:** Developer Tools  
**Codex Session ID:** `019f7306-7262-7371-a03f-6b99df7129bf`

## What it does

Agent Policy Compiler converts written operating rules into explicit `ALLOW`,
`BLOCK`, and `APPROVAL_REQUIRED` decisions. Every restricted result cites its
source, and ambiguous identity cases stop instead of guessing.

## How it was built

I used Codex with GPT-5.6 to design the policy representation, validator,
regression cases, and browser experience. A future live intake path can use
GPT-5.6 Structured Outputs; the public demo uses a tested fixture, and the local
validator remains authoritative.

## Proof

- 7 scenarios: 3 allow, 2 block, 2 approval required
- source citations and a fail-closed ambiguity gate
- automated tests and a deterministic public fixture

## Limits

This MVP is not a production authorization system. A policy owner must approve
any live policy before use.
